# HealthKeeper Medication Timer and Tracker

Project name: HealthKeeper Medication Timer and Tracker

Project description:
Quintet Software Company (QSC) proposes to build a HealthKeeper Timer and Tracker (HealthKeeper). This application will allow patients to monitor, track, and receive reminders about their medication use: when to take the next dose of medication and how many days remain given the number of pills left. Users (patients) will log into their profiles on the HealthKeeper website to view and track their medication use schedule. Once logged in, users will be able to see notifications reminding them of their next dose. Purposes of this app are to help patients take their medication in a timely and consistent manner, without gaps or overdoses. The app will also help patients monitor their medication supply so they can reorder medications before they run out of them to have uninterrupted treatment. This app can be used within hospital environments with in-patients, with clinic outpatients, and anyone willing to obtain a reliable tool to monitor their medication intake and supply.
